Questions

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?


Completed Software Design Document: The Gaming Room
  
  The Gaming Room wanted a multiplayer game called "Draw It or Lose It" that could support multiple games running at the same time, with teams and players on different platforms. The game also needed to handle a large number of high-quality images while running smoothly and securely. In my design document, I focused on clear organization and scalability, making sure the game could grow without performance issues. Writing the design document helped me plan ahead, find potential problems early, and create a clear roadmap for development. If I could improve one part, I would add more details on how game instances communicate in real-time and include visual diagrams to make the architecture easier to understand. To meet user needs, I designed the game to be fast, accessible, and secure, using cloud storage and serverless computing to improve speed and reliability. Security features like user authentication and data protection were also included. Considering user needs is important because it improves the overall experience and keeps players engaged. My approach to software design focused on modular and scalable architecture, using cloud computing and microservices. In the future, I would continue using agile methods and cloud-based solutions to create flexible and efficient applications.
